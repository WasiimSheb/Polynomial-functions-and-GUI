# Polynomial Functions and GUI

## Overview
This Java project provides tools for working with polynomial functions, including a GUI for visualization. The repository contains two main classes:
- **Ex2**: Implements various polynomial operations, such as evaluation, root finding, addition, and area calculation.
- **Ex2_GUI**: Uses `StdDraw` to visualize two polynomials and highlight the area between them.

## Features
- **Polynomial Operations**: Evaluate, add, multiply, and derive polynomials.
- **Root Approximation**: Recursively find roots within a range.
- **Area Calculation**: Approximate the area between two polynomials over a range.
- **GUI Visualization**: Plot polynomials and display information using `StdDraw`.
